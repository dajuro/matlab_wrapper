#+TITLE: TODOs for matlab_wrapper
#+AUTHOR: Marek Rudnicki
#+CATEGORY: matlab_wrap

* IPython notebook support

* TODO Documentation

** DONE Apply guidelines from writethedocs.org

   http://docs.writethedocs.org/

** DONE Sphinx

** DONE Python hosted

** DONE CONTRIBUTING

   - small code snippet illustrating an issue
   - python setup.py develop --user
   - py.test


** TODO FAQ

   - matlab_root (modify PATH, ln -s)
   - /bin/csh



* Spread the word

** Show HN

** reddit

   - python
   - matlab

** comp.soft-sys.matlab

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.soft-sys.matlab

* TODO Python 3 support

* Auto-detect the number of output arguments (nout)

  - check get_nout() from oct2py:

    https://github.com/blink1073/oct2py/blob/master/oct2py/utils.py

  - check mlabwrap


* Auto-convert int to float in matlab.put()

The problem is that in MATLAB this conversion is implicit and writing
e.g.

matlab.put('a', 1)  # <- here 'a' will be int

may lead to unexpected behaviors.


Could be activated via by a parameters:

matlab = matlab_wrapper.MatlabSession(auto_int_conversion=True)

* DONE Make sure that the MATLAB process is gone in __del__()      :canceled:

  - add `matlab._pid' (use features('getpid') in MATLAB, might not
    exist in older versions)
  - check the standard library for the best kill/terminate functions

MATLAB is unresponsive during execution of svd().  I did not find a
way to reasonably kill the process (in destructor), because it hangs
in the engClose().



#+BEGIN_SRC matlab
m.workspace.svd(np.zeros((10000,10000)))
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC python
### Get MATLAB PID
try:
    pid = self.workspace.feature('getpid')
    self._pid = int(pid)
except RuntimeError:
    self._pid = None
#+END_SRC

* DONE Check for /bin/csh on Linux

/bin/csh is required by libeng and the lack of it could be detected by
matlab_wrapper.

<2014-09-29 Mon>

* DONE Enable 32-bit versions

ralili mentioned that it seem to be working on Windows 7, where:

lib_dir = join(matlab_root, "bin", "win32")

* Proper handling of char arrays (strings)

The equivalent type of MATLAB's strings (char arrays) should be
ndarray with dtype=S.

At the moment MATLAB's multidimensional char array conversion to
Python is not correct.

* DONE Error when getting empty Matlab object                        :urgent:

Issue #6 by Jeremy Moreau

* Explicit warning when using Python 3

* Setup a mailing list
